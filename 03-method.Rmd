# Methods

We describe our methods in this chapter.

This file uses the binomial equation quite a bit which is given by

\begin{equation}
	f\left(k\right) = \binom{n}{k} p^k\left(1 - p\right)^{n-k}
	(\#eq:binom)
\end{equation}

We refer to this equation as Equation \@ref(eq:binom).


A normal paragraph.


```{r cars, fig.cap = "An amazing plot"}
data(mtcars)
plot(cars)
```

Let's check a reference to Figure \@ref(fig:cars).


```{r mtcars, fig.cap = "Another Amazing plot"}
plot(mpg ~ hp, mtcars)
```

Now let's check a reference to Figure \@ref(fig:mtcars)

Now let's check a reference to Table \@ref(tab:cartest)

```{r cartest, fig.cap = "Another Amazing plot"}
knitr::kable(mtcars, caption = "My table")
```

Now let's check a reference to Figure \@ref(fig:mtcars)
